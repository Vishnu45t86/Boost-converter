## Introduction

Boost converters are essential components in power electronics for increasing the voltage level of a DC source. This project aims to design and test a boost converter that can convert a 15V DC input to two output voltages, 25V and 30V, with a maximum output power of 20W.

## Features

- **Voltage Step-Up**: Converts 15V DC input to 25V and 30V DC outputs.
- **Power Output**: Achieves a maximum output power of 20W.
- **High Efficiency**: Optimized component values for continuous current mode.
- **Reliable Components**: Uses MOSFET IRF540N and diode IN5408.
- **Optimized Design**: Ensures minimal voltage ripple with appropriate inductor and capacitor values.

## Working Principle

A boost converter operates by storing energy in an inductor during the on-time of a switching element (typically a MOSFET) and releasing that energy to the output during the off-time. This process effectively increases the voltage level at the output.

## Formulas

- **Output Voltage**: \( V_o = \frac{V_s}{1 - D} \)
- **Minimum Inductance for Continuous Current**: \( L_{min} = \frac{D (1 - D)^2}{2f} \)
- **Inductor Current**: \( I_L = \frac{V_s}{R (1 - D)^2} \)
- **Minimum Capacitance to Limit V\(_0\) Ripple to 1%**: \( C_{min} = \frac{D}{R (\Delta V_0 / V_0) f} \)
